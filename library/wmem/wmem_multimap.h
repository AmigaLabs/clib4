 *    @defgroup wmem-multimap Hash Multimap
 *
 *    A hash multimap implementation on top of wmem_map and wmem_tree, storing
 *    multiple values at each hash key in a tree indexed by a 32 bit integer.
 *
 *    The primary use case is a protocol with an ID used as the hash lookup
 *    key that can be reused in a capture, and the frame number used as the
 *    tree key. We often want to find the most recent frame that had a certain
 *    ID, e.g. for request/response matching, and wmem_multimap_lookup32_le()
 *    serves that purpose.
 *
 *    Since the tree implementation is a self-balancing red-black tree, lookup
 *    time is still O(log(n)) even though elements with equivalent hash keys
 *    are usually added in increasing order of frame number.
 *
 *    NOTE: The multimap does not yet support inserting items without
 *    specifying the tree key, because the total capacity of individual trees
 *    (including deleted nodes) is not tracked.
 *
