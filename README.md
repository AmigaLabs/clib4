# clib2 â€“ A C runtime library for AmigaOS4

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/afxgroup/clib2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/afxgroup/clib2)

## What is this?

This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/adtools/clib2">official clib2</a> present in adtools.
The point of this library is to make it Amiga OS4 only to maintain it easily and add all missing clib2 features that are hard to add also on classic amigas.
Classic amigas has also ixemul that is the most complete, <a href="POSIX.md">POSIX</a> compliant, library we have. It is useless share code that most probably no one will use.
Te goal is to try to make it <a href="POSIX.md">POSIX</a> compliant and fix also all C++ problems we have with newer compilers.
All warnings (except really few one) produced by GCC 10 and above are now gone.  
All **deprecated** OS4 functions are replaced by modern one (except for StackSwap i don't find the replacement)

For the original README follow this <a href="https://github.com/adtools/clib2">link</a>

## Limitations and caveats

The new functions and code most of the time is tested. Also some tests has been added to be sure that added features and functions are working correctly. Usually all new functions has been tested against linux. If you find any issue please <a href="https://github.com/afxgroup/clib2/issues">report it</a>.

### Libraries

Clib2 now has also a working shared version called `libc.so`. And of course also all other libs. Don't use newlib .so files when linking because **it will not work**  

If you want to use `dlopen`/`dlsym` with shared objects:

**YOU MUST** compile your Clib2 version of library you want to use!  
**DON'T TRY TO USE** newlib shared objects because it will crash badly!  
**DON'T USE** static libraries otherwise you could have undefined symbols!

The plain `libc.a` now contains also `libnet.a`, `libunix.a`. Socket support and floating point support are always enabled.  
Soft float version is no longer available.

Clib2 define `__THREAD_SAFE` used to check if the library is thread safe

If you want to use the shared version of library remember to pack your OS4 software with all clib2 shared objects othwerwise the elf loader will try to load objects from SOBJS: and it will load newlib one.  
**DON'T overwrite SOBJS: files with your Clib2 files** othwerise OS4 most probably will not load them and you could have problems running existent software!

### New memory allocator

Clib2 now use `Wheel Of Fortune` allocator that is faster than previous one an it seems more robust and with a cleaner and portable code

### Optimized AMCC functions

Some functions like (memchr, memcmp, memcpy and some other) are optimized for SAM440 and SAM460.
Feel free to add other CPU versions.

### Altivec

`libmotovec` has been added to clib2 and enable some altivec functions. Altivec optimizations are not enabled at program start except if you recompile clib2 with *ENABLE_ALTIVEC_AT_START*.  
However two new methods (**enableAltivec** and **disableAltivec**) are present and you can use them to enable or disable optimizations at runtime.  
Keep in mind that clib2 is not compiled with altivec optimizations for all files.

### Shared objects

Shared objects **are working** also with clib2 (there is an example under test_programs/dlopen folder).
using dlopen/dlsym will not crash anymore however there is a bug in `libstdc++.so` that is causing a crash on program start.  
So if you want to use libstdc++ it is better to remove it and link against the static version.

### Large file support

Large files are now supported and tested (A working version of p7zip has been tested with a 8GB file without any problem). 

### SYSV functions

Clib2 now contains **shm*** and **msg*** functions. It needs <a href="http://www.os4depot.net/share/development/library/misc/sysvipc.lha">SYSV IPC</a> library. If you don't install it those functions will not work and will return to you an **ENOSYS** error.

### Unix path support

`libunix` doesn't exists anymore but you can enable/disable unix support at any time. By default unix support it is disabled. If you want to enable it at runtime you can create a `.unix` file inside the exe directory or use **enableUnixPaths()** function in your software.  
You can also disable it at runtime using **disableUnixPaths()**. However is not reccomanded to enable and disable it at runtime because you could have problems with internal structures.

### wchar / wctype

All **wctype** functions should be working correctly now. We need a valid test suite.  
All **wchar** functions are now implemented and tested but maybe something is not working correctly. 
There are no valid tests except a little few so if you find any issue please <a href="https://github.com/afxgroup/clib2/issues">report it</a>.

### Locale

Locales relies always to OS4 locales but now you can set the encoding so wide functons will work correctly.
Accepted encodings are:

`C-UTF-8`
`C-EUCJP`
`C-SJIS`
`C-JIS`
`ISO-8859-1`

### Math library

Math library has been replaced with openlibm (https://github.com/JuliaMath/openlibm).   
This version is faster and more compatible and contains also fenv support that wasn't implemented in clib2.

### Complex numbers

Complex numbers has been added to libm and tests has been added to test that everything is working correctly.  
A lot of other functions has been added trying to make OS4 ports easier.

### libauto

Clib2 now contain also libauto with almost all OS4 components. We'll try to keep them updated.

### libresolv

Added resolv library to use dns functions. A lot of socket functions that was using bsdsocket.library now use this library.
And thanks to this library more functions have been added to socket library 

### libcrypt

Added crypt library that implements crypt and crypt_r 

* ##### About salt
The characters that can be specified are [a-zA-Z0-9. /]. Lowercase alphabets, uppercase alphabets, numbers,'.' And'/'.

By adjusting the format of the salt passed to the crypt function, you can ** specify the hash algorithm **. Make salt like $ (id) $ (salt string) $. id is a number to specify the hash algorithm. (The hash algorithm will be described later) (By the way, the $ mark at the end of the salt string can be omitted.)

* ##### Salt id and hash algorithm

Correspondence table between id and hash algorithm


| ID  | Hash algorithm |  
|-----|----------------|
| 1   |      MD5
| 2a  | Blowfish |
| 5   | SHA-256  |
| 6   | SHA-512  |

If not specified, it will be DES. DES is very vulnerable and is not recommended because it uses only 2 characters for Salt and only recognizes passwords for up to 8 characters.

| Hash algorithm | Number of characters in the hashed string |  
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| MD5            | 22 Characters                             
| SHA-256        | 43 Characters                             |
| SHA-512        | 86 Characters                             |

Number of characters in salt DES: Fixed to 2 characters (only the first 2 characters of the salt string are seen, the characters after that are ignored) MD5: Up to 8 characters (see only the first 8 characters of the salt string, the characters after that are ignored)

About the security of the hash algorithm DES<MD5<SHA-256<SHA-512 And, the larger the id number, the higher the safety.

Use `-lcrypt` option when linking.

### Debug

To use `debug` functions you have to explicitly pass `DEBUG=true` to GNUMakefile.os4 and 
debug functions will be enabled 

### Misc

Clib2 now supports opening directories with open() and opendir() functions. There are also new other functions that are used with fd int files.
Check `fcntl.h` for details 

### Known problems

Don't call `exit()` function in an `alarm()` handler otherwise your program will be stuck at exit.

### TODO

- There is a memory leak at clib2 end needs to be tracked down  
- Try to use Microsoft <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc">`mimalloc`</a> as memory allocator that should be faster and more better when there are multiple cores.
- Create a shared library
- Add a test suite
- Try to use some functions/headers from https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib to improve speed

Because this library is in part based upon free software it would be uncourteous not to make it free software itself. The BSD license would probably be appropriate here.
